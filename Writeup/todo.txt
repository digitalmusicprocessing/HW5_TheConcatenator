Introductory points:
- Sanity check: are we looking for variety/randomness, or looking for form made from variety?
- NOTE: If you send the same drum loop into the combobulator, you'll always get the same thing, so vary the randomness of the input

Finished
--------
* Note that we use a smaller L than driedger
* Cite patch match and explain the connection to
* Summarize Driedger technique
* Be precise about the complexity of Driedger and the complexity of this algorithm
* NOTE in writeup: obstacle course doesn't necessarily tell us where the model can go
* Be sure to mention that we do stereo at 44100hz
* Summarize the entirety of the algorithm
* Block diagram for sampling algorithm
* Figure comparing activation patters to Driedger, talk about Gaussian vs exponential qualitative characteristics of activations
- Note that for Driedger, p=1 can actually lead to multiple activations

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions for Ben:
* How is the block diagram?
* Do we have adequate citations for concatenative synthesis algorithms?
